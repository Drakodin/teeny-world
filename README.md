# Teeny World
A simple workshop for HackGTeeny 2021. This repository will remain public for your reference.

## What are we building?
The world is an interesting place. Maybe you have a place you really like and you'd like to show it off! This is how! This is a simple website called "My Teeny World" that shows you different strategies and design types with HTML and CSS, as well as some basic Javascript.

### Finished Product
Of course, your location doesn't have to be Georgia Tech, but I used it for my example.
